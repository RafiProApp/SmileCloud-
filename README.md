# Triangle Project - SmileCloud

This project allows the user to input three points and visualize the triangle, including its angles.

## Method
- The triangle is drawn using HTML Canvas and JavaScript for simple and accurate rendering.
- Angles are calculated in Python using the Law of Cosines and converted to degrees.

## Limitations
- No validation to ensure the points form a valid triangle.
- Minimal styling, no advanced CSS.

## External Help
- Consulted Python and JavaScript documentation, and used ChatGPT for guidance on calculations and logic.
- Applied my own skills to implement the solution practically, after learning from an important video I watched several times.
